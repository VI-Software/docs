3. Download the version compatible with your operating system. In this tutorial, we are covering Windows, so we will download `VI-Software-Launcher-setup-(version number).exe`.
4. Starting from Beta 1.6.3, the installer includes a copy of the license on Windows. To proceed with the process, review the license carefully and click 'I agree' as shown in the image.
