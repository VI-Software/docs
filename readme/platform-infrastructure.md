# ðŸ’» Platform Infrastructure

### **Platform Infrastructure Overview**

Our platform runs entirely on our own hardware. Everything is managed using a Proxmox server with LXC containers, and each app runs in a lightweight Docker container based on Alpine Linux. The host system uses Ubuntu.

Most core services run in a centralized LXC container, including:

* A custom authentication service (a modified fork of _drasl_) that integrates with PostgreSQL for better performance. Users authenticate via Xbox accounts through a secure, dedicated verification service.
* A REST API that enables connected servers and servicesâ€”like Discord botsâ€”to interact with the platform.
* The main website, user dashboard, and a CDN for distributing files.

The platform uses MariaDB and Redis for storage and caching, running locally within the same environment for simplicity and performance.

Network security is handled through a dedicated firewall, with outbound traffic routed through a VPN and managed using `iptables`. We monitor infrastructure health using Grafana.

Deployments and updates (including the launcher) are handled via GitHub Actions. We regularly back up databases to an S3-compatible server, and all source code is mirrored on GitHub and GitLab.

While we donâ€™t have automated failover in place yet, we prioritize data safety and privacy. Sensitive user data is encrypted, and we follow GDPR-compliant practicesâ€”including tools for users to delete their accounts if they choose.
