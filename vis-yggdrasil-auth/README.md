# VIS Yggdrasil Auth

VIS' Yggdrasil Auth is based on the [Drasl ](https://github.com/unmojaned/drasl)project, which in turn draws inspiration from Mojang's authentication system. Adopting this framework not only enhances robustness but also provides VIS with significant autonomy from Mojang and Microsoft.

The decision to base VIS' Yggdrasil Auth on the Drasl project enables the establishment of an independent authentication system, offering a high level of security. This independence from Mojang and Microsoft adds an extra layer of resilience and stability to VIS's authentication services. It also allows for more flexible and controlled management of user accounts, providing greater oversight and customization of authentication processes.

By adopting this architecture, VIS benefits from the inherent reliability and experience of Mojang's authentication system while creating a tailored framework that meets the specific needs of the VIS environment. This adaptability results in improved security, stability, and efficiency in authentication services, ensuring an optimal experience for users and facilitating account management for administrators.
