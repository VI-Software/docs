# ðŸ“” Code of Conduct

## **Community Code of Conduct**

Our community is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment for all contributors, regardless of background, identity, or experience. We believe that a positive and supportive atmosphere fosters creativity, collaboration, and mutual respect. To ensure that everyone feels comfortable, valued, and respected, we have established this Code of Conduct (CoC), which applies to all members of the community, including contributors, maintainers, and users.

## **1. Be Inclusive and Respectful:**

* Embrace the diversity within our community and treat everyone with the utmost respect, kindness, and dignity.
* Acknowledge and celebrate different perspectives, experiences, and identities. We encourage open dialogue that fosters learning and understanding.
* Language matters: Avoid using offensive, discriminatory, or derogatory comments, including but not limited to personal attacks, insults, and slurs. This extends to all forms of communication within the community, such as written text, voice, and images.
* Be aware of your privilege, and be mindful of how it may impact others within the community. Seek to create space for voices that may not be as prominent.

## **2. Maintain a Welcoming Environment:**

* Treat others with empathy and consideration. Every individual deserves to feel respected and included, regardless of their level of experience or familiarity with the community.
* Welcome newcomers with enthusiasm and support. Help others feel comfortable by offering guidance, answering questions, and making sure they feel valued.
* Recognize the value of every community member, and encourage collaboration rather than competition. We all benefit from a spirit of teamwork.

## **3. Practice Empathy and Active Listening:**

* Take the time to listen thoughtfully to others. Understand that everyone has unique experiences and viewpoints, and their opinions are shaped by those experiences.
* Be open to constructive feedback and take it as an opportunity for personal growth. Acknowledge that sometimes we all make mistakes, and approach learning as an ongoing journey.
* Show compassion and understanding when disagreements arise. Aim to resolve differences in a way that strengthens relationships rather than causing division.

## **4. Respect Privacy:**

* Respect the personal boundaries and privacy of others. Do not share personal information about other community members without their explicit consent.
* Recognize that individuals may choose not to disclose certain aspects of their identity or experiences, and honor those choices.
* Be aware of the sensitivity of private or confidential information shared within the community. Always ensure that you are respecting others' privacy both in public and private spaces.

## **5. Handle Disagreements Constructively:**

* Disagreements are natural and can lead to healthy debates and innovation when handled respectfully. When addressing a disagreement, focus on the topic at hand rather than attacking the person involved.
* Use calm and professional language when discussing contentious issues. Disagreements should be approached with a mindset of resolution, not escalation.
* If a conflict cannot be resolved independently, seek mediation from community leaders or trusted members to facilitate a respectful resolution.

## **6. Report Violations:**

* If you encounter behavior that violates this Code of Conduct or feel that you have been subjected to misconduct, please report it to the community leaders. We are committed to addressing all complaints promptly and thoroughly.
* Reports should be submitted in good faith and with the aim of improving the community. All concerns will be treated with confidentiality and respect, and investigated in a fair and unbiased manner.
* If you witness unacceptable behavior, it is important to speak up, as it helps protect the integrity and inclusivity of the community.

## **7. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior:**

* Unacceptable behavior, including but not limited to harassment, discrimination, and abuse, will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
* Individuals who violate the Code of Conduct may face consequences that range from a warning to temporary or permanent exclusion from the community, depending on the severity and frequency of the violation.
* Community leaders reserve the right to take corrective actions in cases where the integrity and safety of the community are at risk.

## **8. Community Leadership and Accountability:**

* Community leaders are responsible for ensuring that the Code of Conduct is enforced and followed. They are tasked with creating and maintaining a positive environment for all participants.
* Leaders have the authority to remove, edit, or reject any contentâ€”such as comments, commits, code, issues, or pull requestsâ€”that does not align with the principles set forth in this Code of Conduct.
* Leaders are also responsible for investigating reports of misconduct and taking appropriate action to address violations, while maintaining transparency and fairness in their decision-making.

## **9. Scope and Application:**

* This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces associated with our community, both online and offline. This includes but is not limited to GitHub repositories, forums, chat channels, events, conferences, and other community platforms.
* The Code of Conduct applies to all interactions within the community, whether in public forums or private communications, and extends to interactions both on and off community platforms.

## **10. Our Promise to You:**

* We are committed to creating an inclusive environment where all members can contribute, collaborate, and thrive without fear of discrimination, harassment, or exclusion.
* We promise to uphold and enforce this Code of Conduct consistently, fairly, and transparently, with the goal of ensuring that every community member feels welcome, valued, and heard.
* As part of our commitment, we will regularly review and revise this Code of Conduct to address emerging issues and to keep it in line with our community's values and goals.

By adhering to this Code of Conduct, you help foster a positive, inclusive, and thriving community where everyone can work together towards shared goals. We appreciate your dedication to making this space welcoming for all, and we thank you for your contributions. Your actions and words have the power to shape the community, and together, we can build a respectful and supportive environment where all contributors can flourish.
