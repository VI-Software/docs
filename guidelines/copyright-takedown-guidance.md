# 📔 Copyright Takedown Guidance

VI Software respects copyright law and expects users to do the same. This guidance explains how to submit copyright takedown notices and counter-notices under EU and Spanish law (Directive 2000/31/EC and Ley 1/2011). Misuse of this process, including knowingly submitting false or misleading claims, may result in account suspension or other actions.
