# ðŸ“” Platform License Agreement

### **Platform License Agreement (PLA) for server**

Effective Date: January 1, 2025

## **Introduction**

This Platform License Agreement ("Agreement") governs the terms and conditions under which server owners ("Licensee," "you," or "your") may use the services provided by VI Software ("we," "our," or "the Company") for hosting servers within the VI Software platform. By accessing, using, or maintaining a server on our platform, you agree to comply with all the terms and conditions outlined in this Agreement.

This Agreement is essential for fostering a respectful, secure, and sustainable environment for all server owners and users in the VI Software ecosystem, and as such, it establishes clear guidelines for the usage and management of the platform's tools, services, and resources.

## 1. **Grant of License**

VI Software grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to operate and manage a server on the VI Software platform, subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Licensee may host content, applications, and services on the server they create within the platform, provided that these activities align with the platformâ€™s policies, including the **Code of Conduct**, **Terms of Service**, and other applicable regulations.

This license grants the Licensee the ability to configure, maintain, and manage the server according to their specifications. However, VI Software retains the right to monitor and take corrective actions if necessary, including suspending or terminating server access in response to policy violations or harmful activities.

## 2. **Platform Usage Guidelines**

### **2.1 Server Management**

The Licensee is responsible for the operation and management of their server. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Ensuring the server remains compliant with all relevant legal, regulatory, and ethical guidelines.
* Maintaining a secure environment on the server and taking necessary actions to prevent unauthorized access.
* Configuring server resources, managing content, and implementing security measures to protect the server from vulnerabilities, including DDoS attacks, malware, and unauthorized modifications.

### **2.2 Content and Behavior Rules**

The Licensee agrees that all content hosted on their server must comply with [VI Softwareâ€™s **Fair Use Policy**](fair-use-policy.md) and [**Code of Conduct**](code-of-conduct.md), and will not:

## 3. **Server Restrictions**

In addition to the content and behavior guidelines mentioned above, the Licensee acknowledges the following limitations on the use of the platform and its resources:

* **No Unauthorized Commercial Use**: Servers may not be used for commercial purposes without explicit written consent from VI Software. This includes, but is not limited to, offering paid services, hosting paid advertisements, or using the server infrastructure to conduct business without prior approval.

This includes exploiting system vulnerabilities, bypassing limitations set by the platform, or engaging in unauthorized access to platform resources.

### **4.1 Adherence to Legal Standards**

The Licensee must comply with all local, regional, and international laws applicable to the operation of their server, including data protection and privacy regulations, intellectual property laws, and online conduct regulations.

The Licensee is solely responsible for understanding and abiding by the relevant laws.

### **4.2 Illegal Content and Activity Reporting**

VI Software reserves the right to suspend or terminate server access if illegal activities or harmful content is found. This includes, but is not limited to, distributing child exploitation material, conducting identity theft, or engaging in cyberattacks. The Licensee agrees to cooperate fully with legal authorities if such content or activities are discovered.

## 5. **Server Availability and Reliability**

While VI Software aims to maintain a high level of server uptime, the Licensee acknowledges that the platform's services may be subject to occasional outages or disruptions.

However, we will make reasonable efforts to restore services promptly.
