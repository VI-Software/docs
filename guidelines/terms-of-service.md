1. **Acceptance of Terms**\
   By accessing or using VI Softwareâ€™s platform to create or join modded Minecraft servers ("Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must discontinue use of the Services immediately. These Terms apply to all users of the platform, including but not limited to server creators ("Licensees"), players, and contributors.
2. **Platform Overview**\
   VI Software offers a platform that enables users to create modded Minecraft servers with a range of custom modifications and manage them via an easy-to-use launcher. Users can access and play on these modded servers, interact with others, and enjoy enhanced Minecraft gameplay experiences.
3. **Server Governance by the Platform License Agreement (PLA)**\
   Server Creators (Licensees): If you are a server creator, you must agree to the Platform License Agreement (PLA) in addition to these Terms of Service. The PLA governs the operation, management, and content of your modded Minecraft server and supersedes any conflicting provisions in this TOS. In case of any conflict between the TOS and the PLA, the terms of the PLA shall take precedence with respect to server operations.\
   Player Access: Players can access modded Minecraft servers hosted by creators using the VI Software launcher. Players must adhere to the Terms of Service and the specific rules set by the server creators, as described in the respective serverâ€™s guidelines. However, server operations themselves are still governed by the PLA.
4. **Account Creation and Responsibilities**\
   To use the VI Software platform, users must create an account. By doing so, you agree to provide accurate and up-to-date information. You are responsible for the security of your account and for all activities that occur under your account, whether or not authorized by you. VI Software is not liable for any unauthorized access to your account.
5. **License to Create and Access Modded Servers**\
   License for Server Creators (Licensees): VI Software grants server creators a non-exclusive, revocable license to use the platform to create, configure, and manage modded Minecraft servers. As a server creator, you are responsible for ensuring your serverâ€™s compliance with these Terms and the Platform License Agreement (PLA).\

   To maintain a safe, respectful, and enjoyable environment, users agree to the following platform usage guidelines:

You must have the necessary rights to share and use any content provided to other players.

9. **Dispute Resolution**\
   Server Disputes: If disputes arise between players or between players and server creators, VI Software encourages all parties to attempt resolution privately or through platform tools (if available). VI Software will not mediate disputes, but will take appropriate action if violations of these Terms occur.\
   Third-Party Services: If server creators or players utilize third-party services, such as modding tools, plugins, or external websites, VI Software is not responsible for any disputes or issues related to those services. Users should address issues directly with the third-party providers.
10. **Prohibited Activities**\
    The following activities are strictly prohibited on the platform:

This includes sharing or using pirated software or engaging in unauthorized distribution of mods or other content. Users are fully responsible for their actions, and VI Software will not be held liable for any illegal acts or violations of laws in any jurisdiction.
* **Malicious Software and Exploits**: The use of malicious software, hacks, cheats, or exploits to disrupt gameplay or server functionality is not allowed. Server creators must also ensure that their servers do not host or facilitate such activities.
