VI Software provides an integrated software solution that facilitates the development, deployment, customization, and management of modded Minecraft servers. Users of the platform may configure their servers with proprietary or third-party modifications, participate in multiplayer environments, and interact within an expanded Minecraft gameplay ecosystem through the VI Software launcher. The platform may, at its discretion, introduce additional features, expansions, and software enhancements, which may be subject to supplemental terms.

The PLA governs the operational, managerial, and content-related aspects of hosted servers. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Terms of Service Agreement and the PLA, the provisions of the PLA shall supersede and prevail in matters concerning server governance and administration.

#### **3.2 Player Access & Responsibilities**

Players accessing modded servers via the VI Software launcher must comply with both these Terms of Service and any supplemental regulations or conditions imposed by individual Licensees within their respective server environments.

By submitting or uploading User Content, you represent and warrant that:

* You are either the owner of the User Content or an authorized agent with full authority to grant the rights and licenses specified in these Terms of Service.

### **9. Monetization Restrictions**

Monetization of any kind through the VI Software platform is strictly prohibited unless the user possesses a valid commercial license issued by VI Software. This applies to, but is not limited to:

* **Streamers and Content Creators**: If a streamer is playing on a server hosted on the VI Software platform, the server must hold a valid commercial license for the streamer to monetize any content related to their participation in that server. If the server does not have a commercial license, the streamer is not permitted to generate revenue through monetized streams, ad revenue, sponsorships, or donations related to their gameplay on that server.
* **Server Owners and Marketers**: Server owners and any individuals or entities marketing, promoting, or operating servers for profit on the platform must possess a valid commercial license issued by VI Software. This includes, but is not limited to, individuals who run or advertise paid access to servers, offer in-game purchases (such as selling premium items, access to exclusive content, or currency), or otherwise profit from server operations. The commercial license must be held by the server owner or operator responsible for the monetization activities, including server marketers who promote paid servers.
* **Compliance with Mojang EULA**: All servers hosted on the VI Software platform must comply with the Mojang End User License Agreement (EULA) regarding monetization. Servers must not engage in practices that violate the Mojang EULA, including but not limited to selling in-game advantages, loot boxes, or charging for access to gameplay that violates Mojang's monetization policies. Any server found in violation of the Mojang EULA will be subject to immediate suspension or removal from the platform.
* **Third-Party Partnerships and Sponsorships**: If a user, such as a server owner or content creator, engages in any third-party commercial partnerships, promotions, or sponsorships that involve the use of VI Software's platform, content, or servers, the user must possess a valid commercial license issued by VI Software before entering into such agreements.

Monetization is only permitted when explicitly allowed through a formal agreement with VI Software. Any user found violating these restrictions, including any violations of the Mojang EULA, may face account suspension, termination, and legal action.

### **13. Age Requirement & Guardian Responsibility**

VI Software is not intended for users under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect, process, or store personal data from anyone under this age. If you are under 16, you must not use the platform or provide any personal information.
